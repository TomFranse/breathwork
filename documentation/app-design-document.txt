App Design Document – Breathwork Timer App
Author: UX/UI Designer / Product Designer
Standard: IEEE 830-1998 (Software Requirements Specification)

1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The Breathwork Timer App is a simple web application that guides users through breathing exercises using visual animations and sound cues. Users can set their breathing patterns and start a session where a soft wave or bell sound accompanies them.

The app is designed for stress reduction, meditation, and breathing techniques such as Wim Hof, box breathing, and pranayama.

1.2 Scope
Purely frontend application, built in React.
Uses MUI (Material UI) for all UI components.
Hosted via Firebase, allowing for fast deployment and PWA support.
Smooth transitions and a calming user experience.
Mobile-friendly layout, optimized for both smartphones and desktops.
2. Functional Specifications
2.1 Settings Page
Configurable parameters:
- Breaths before Hold – Number of breath cycles before entering hold phase
- Inhale/Exhale Time (seconds) – Duration for each inhale and exhale phase
- Breath Hold Target (seconds) – Maximum breath hold time (achieved in final round)
- Number of Rounds – How many complete sequences to perform

Automatic adjustments:
The app automatically calculates the breath hold time progression:
- First round: ⅓ of target hold time
- Second round: ⅔ of target hold time
- Final round: Full target hold time

Round Sequence:
1. Main Breathing Phase:
   - Repeat for [Breaths before Hold] times:
     * Inhale (duration: Inhale/Exhale Time)
     * Exhale (duration: Inhale/Exhale Time)
2. Hold Sequence:
   - Hold breath (duration: calculated based on round)
   - Inhale (duration: Inhale/Exhale Time)
   - Hold breath (duration: 15 seconds, fixed)
   - Exhale (duration: Inhale/Exhale Time)

Interactions:
Play button: Starts the breathing session
Pause button: Allows the user to pause and resume the session
Stop button: Ends the session and returns to the settings page
2.2 Breathing Timer Page
Visual guidance:
Expanding and contracting circle (smooth animated transitions) as a breathing indicator.
Progress bar or subtle indicator showing how many rounds remain.
Auditory guidance:
Soft wave or bell sound as a cue.
Dynamic sound cues based on the phase:
Inhalation → Soft rising tone.
Exhalation → Soft fading tone.
Breath hold → Silent or subtle tone.
3. UI/UX Design
3.1 Color Scheme
The UI follows soft, calming pastel colors with contrast dynamics for focus.

Proposed color theme:
Background: Soft lavender blue (#D6E2F0) for a soothing base.
Primary components: Pastel peach (#F9DCC4) and mint green (#B8E0D2).
Interactive elements (buttons, progress bar): Deep teal (#4B908D) for contrast.
Text and icons: Soft dark gray (#3A3A3A) for readability.
3.2 Layout
Mobile-first design, but well-scaled for desktops.

Settings Page:
MUI Slider components for adjusting breath timing.
MUI Switch buttons for options such as enabling/disabling sounds.
MUI Play button centrally placed and highly visible.
Breathing Timer Page:
Large centered animation circle.
Clear play/pause/stop buttons at the bottom.
Soft transitions and fading effects between phases.
4. Technical Specifications
4.1 Technology Stack
Framework: React.js (Create React App)
UI: Material UI (MUI v5)
Animations: Framer Motion
Audio: Tone.js for synthesized breathing sounds
State Management: React Context
Testing: Jest + React Testing Library
Hosting: Firebase Hosting (deployment setup in later phase)

4.2 Application Logic
Timer-based state management with React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
Pause/Resume logic: Timer is temporarily stopped and resumes upon button click
End of session: Automatic return to the settings page
Audio synthesis:
- Rising sine wave for inhale
- Falling sine wave for exhale
- Subtle drone for breath hold
Fixed breath hold progression (⅓, ⅔, full) per round

5. Testing & Deployment
5.1 Development & Testing
Jest and React Testing Library for:
- Timer logic
- State management
- Component rendering
- User interactions
Mobile responsiveness testing via Chrome DevTools and Lighthouse

5.2 Deployment
Initial local development setup
Firebase deployment configuration in later phase

6. Future Enhancements
Progressive Web App (PWA) support
Additional breathing techniques (e.g., box breathing)
Sound selection option (e.g., custom bell or nature sounds)
Extra visualizations such as a moving wave instead of a circle
Social sharing feature
Firebase CI/CD setup
Storybook integration for component development
